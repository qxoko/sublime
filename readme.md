# Sublime Text Configuration

With the release of ST4, I have reset and refreshed my ST3 loadout that I've been dragging around for a long time.  Many parts of it were falling off, or had lost parity with other parts (I recently switched operating systems full-time and allowed the OS-level keymaps to completely diverge).

This new configuration should hopefully remain minimal, being mostly made up of sensible tweaks like keymaps and some syntax-specific display settings.

It will also host in-development colour schemes or even tiny plugins from time to time.  A lot of my own little custom plugin hacks don't merit any kind of separate release.

#### Colour Scheme

Lone Dark is a mashup of [Rose Pine](https://github.com/rose-pine/rose-pine-theme) and a Sublime Text port of [Jonathan Blow's Emacs theme](https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen/sublime_witness), an unholy abomination created by accident during a palette swap that I just... quite like.  I make no apologies.

The ST4 Adaptive theme has had a much needed cleanup and flattening — almost entirely matching the aesthetics I had modded into my old themes in the past — so in the ST4 era I choose to only maintain colour scheme files and save the effort.
