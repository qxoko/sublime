# Sublime Configuration

#### Sensible Stuff

#### Colour Scheme

Lone Dark is a mashup of Rose Pine and Jonathan Blow's Emacs theme, an unholy abomination created by accident during a palette swap that I just... quite like.

The ST4 Adaptive theme has had a much needed cleanup and flattening — almost entirely matching the aesthetics I had modded into my old themes in the past — so in the ST4 era I choose to only maintain colour scheme files and save the effort.
